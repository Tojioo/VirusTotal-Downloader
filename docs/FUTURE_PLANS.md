# Future Enhancement Plans for VirusTotal Downloader

## Malicious File Evaluation and Risk-Based Download Prevention

### Overview
This document outlines future enhancements for the VirusTotal Downloader that would add intelligent malicious file evaluation and risk-based download prevention capabilities.

It was mostly written by a human and made pretty by a clanker ദ്ദി(ᵔᗜᵔ)

### Planned Features

#### 1. Risk Assessment Engine
- **Implementation**: Add a risk scoring algorithm that evaluates VirusTotal scan results
- **Scoring Criteria**:
  - Number of engines detecting malware (weighted by engine reputation)
  - Type of threats detected (malware, trojans, ransomware, etc.)
  - Engine consensus level (unanimous vs. split decisions)
  - File type risk factors (executables vs. documents)
  - Source reputation (known malicious domains)

#### 2. Configurable Risk Thresholds
- **User Settings**: Allow users to configure what constitutes "malicious" (Final naming needs to be less ambiguous in meaning)
  - **"Low" Risk Threshold**: Block files detected by 3+ engines
  - **"Medium" Risk Threshold**: Block files detected by 2+ engines  
  - **"High" Risk Threshold**: Block files detected by 1+ engine
  - **Paranoid Mode**: Block files with any suspicious indicators (Naming is final :D)

#### 3. Risk-Based Download Prevention
- **Auto-Block Feature**: When "Auto-Download" is `ON`
  - Evaluate scan results before auto-downloading
  - If risk score exceeds threshold, prevent download
  - Show risk assessment notification to user
  - Provide option to "Download Anyway" with explicit warning

#### 4. Enhanced User Interface
- **Risk Indicators**: 
  - Color-coded risk levels (green/yellow/orange/red)
  - Risk percentage display in reports
  - Detailed risk breakdown showing contributing factors
- **Warning Dialogs**:
  - Pre-download risk warnings for manual downloads
  - Explanation of why file was flagged as risky
  - Educational content about detected threats

#### 5. Whitelist/Blacklist Management
- **Domain Whitelist**: Trusted sources that bypass risk assessment
- **File Type Filtering**: Custom rules for different file extensions
- **Hash-Based Exceptions**: Allow previously approved files
- **Temporary Override**: Time-limited exceptions for specific files

#### 6. Advanced Analytics
- **Download Statistics**: Track blocked vs. allowed downloads
- **Risk Trends**: Historical risk assessment data
- **False Positive Tracking**: Learn from user override decisions
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integration with additional security feeds

### Technical Implementation Considerations

#### Backend Changes
- **Risk Calculation Module**: New JavaScript module for risk assessment
- **Storage Schema Updates**: Enhanced data structure for risk metadata
- **API Integration**: Support for additional threat intelligence sources
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching of risk assessments

#### User Experience
- **Settings Panel**: New configuration section for risk management
- **Education Mode**: Optional explanatory tooltips and guides
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support for risk warnings
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Responsive design for all risk interfaces

### Implementation Timeline
1. **Phase 1**: Basic risk scoring and threshold configuration
2. **Phase 2**: Download prevention and warning dialogs
3. **Phase 3**: Whitelist/blacklist management
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced analytics and threat intelligence integration

### Security Considerations
- **Privacy**: All risk assessment performed locally, no data sent to third parties
- **Transparency**: Open source risk calculation algorithms
- **User Control**: Always provide override options for advanced users
- **Performance**: Risk assessment should not significantly impact download speed

### Success Metrics
- **Malware Prevention Rate**: Percentage of actual malware blocked
- **False Positive Rate**: Legitimate files incorrectly flagged
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on risk assessment accuracy
- **Adoption Rate**: Percentage of users who enable risk-based features

**Note**: This document serves as a roadmap for future development. Implementation of these features would require additional planning, testing, and user feedback to ensure effectiveness and usability.
